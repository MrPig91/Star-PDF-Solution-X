# Star PDF Solution X

A cross platform version of my WPF application Star PDF Solution. Most feature were ported over besides displaying progress bars during merging and splitting and the ability to send PDFs through command line arguments.

If you do plan to install the windows version I recomment installing [Star PDF Solution](https://payhip.com/b/YNz2K), which is written in WPF and includes window explorer context menu shortcuts.


## How to use

[Link to WPF version of Star PDF Solution ReadMe](https://github.com/MrPig91/StarPDFSolution)

Same instructions as the original application minus the ablity to use context menu options in Windows file explorer. Also the drag and drop feature does not work on Linux.
